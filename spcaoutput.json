    "story": "These two gorgeous girls were actually born here back in September. It has been a long journey seeing them grow from wee little wriggly, grey babies into the amazing rabbits they are now. They have been in foster care for a while but are now ready to truly begin their new lives as loved family members.",
    "bio": "Super cute and super fluffy. These two lovely bunnies will need a home where attentive grooming is a must. Their fur is soft and fine so a brush and comb three times a week should see them maintaining their plush coat; knot free. Simply adorable and easy to love these sisters get along fine and with your loving trust they will soon blossom.  Indoor living or outdoor will suit but you may need an indoor grooming set up (so the coat maintenance is easy peasy.) Large space required as these girls love to run and they are fast."
